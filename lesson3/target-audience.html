      <h2>Target Audience</h2>
      <p>My target audience is business owners who are looking to expand their businesses and/or publicity in the area. I also want to advertise to members of the community who are looking for information about business, attractions, or our area in general.</p>
      <h2>Personas</h2>
      <img class='personas' src='./images/workout-woman.jpg' alt='Woman Exercising'>
      <p>This is Anna Beckham. She and her husband have 2 children and live in a city 20 minutes from ours. She is a business owner and has been running a couple succesful gyms in some nearby cities for around 8 years. She is looking to open another location, and we want the site to show her the appeal of our city and help her want to open her next gym here. She might go to the site to see what other businesses are in the area, or if she will have competition for her gym. She would also visit the site to check out family-friendly activities and places in the area where she could take her kids, such as a swimming pool or craft fair.</p>
      <img class='personas' src='./images/hiking-man.jpg' alt='Man Outside'>
      <p>This is Shaun Russo. He lives in our town and loves the outdoors and having fun with his friends. He might go to our website to see if the weather will be good enough for his weekend hike, and he would want to see outdoor attractions and fun places to check out with his friends. Along with information about outdoor activities, he would also love to see information about places like indoor climbing gyms, local restaurants, movie theaters, etc.
